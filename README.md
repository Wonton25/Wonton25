I'm currently working on my Github profile.
I'm currently learning how to navigate Github.
I would like to collaborate with others in the realm of Software Development, Cloud Engineering, and Mobile Application Development.
I am very new to all of this so please share any tips/tricks you may have.
I can be reached at SuwandaBaker@yahoo.com
